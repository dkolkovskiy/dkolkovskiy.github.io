<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Problem</h2>

<p> The traditional methods of training for MRI machine operations face several significant challenges. First, the complexity of MRI technology can be daunting, especially for beginners, making it difficult to grasp essential operations through conventional means. Additionally, hands-on training opportunities are often limited due to constraints in machine availability, space, and instructor time, which can impede learners' access to necessary practice. Inconsistencies in training, due to varied teaching styles and instructor availability, further complicate the learning process, leading to uneven skill acquisition. Moreover, traditional training may not fully engage learners, resulting in lower retention of knowledge. Finally, the fear of making mistakes on expensive, real-world equipment can hinder confidence and competency development among trainees. These issues collectively pose logistical, educational, and psychological barriers to effectively learning MRI operations.
